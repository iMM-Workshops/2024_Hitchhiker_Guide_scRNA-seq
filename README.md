Each day will be carried by one trainer and you will be able to find the material associated with each Day in the corresponding directory.
Some files exceeding 25 MB will be availble thru other means. 

## Day 1 - Fundamentals of scRNA-seq 
**_Trainer:_** Tomas Gomes, Instituto de Medicina Molecular \
This day, you will be introduced to the single cell RNAseq technology (scRNAseq) as well as their general means to analyse the raw data generated by the sequencers to the count matrices. We will also help you te set up your working environment.

**_Programming languages:_** Python, R

## Day 2 - Integration
**_Trainer:_** Antonio Sousa, University of Turku \
This day, you will learn how to integrate several dataset together to find a common space in which the different cells type can be understood with a common ground.

**_Programming languages:_** R

## Day 3 - Adaptive immune receptor
**_Trainer:_** Lisa Dratva, Sanger Institute & Stem Cell Institute Cambridge) \
You will learn how to analyse a specific type of scRNAseq dataset with the T cell Receptor of some immune cells called T cells. In addition to the gene expression (GEX) some immune cells can be types using this receptor's sequence (VDJ)

**_Programming languages:_** Python

## Day 4 - Velocity 
**_Trainer:_** Zhisong He, ETH Zurich \
You will learn how to perform pseudotime and trajectory analysis.

**_Programming languages:_** Python and R

## Day 5 - Spatial Transcriptomics 
**_Trainer:_** Anna Maguza, Würzburg Institute of Systems Immunology \
Introduction to spatial transcriptomics

**_Programming languages:_** Python
